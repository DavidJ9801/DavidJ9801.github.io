lets go real stuff:
### section 2
Since his inception in interwar imperial Japan, Endo caught no breaks from the brutality of the world - within and without his home country. Stricken with sickness and strife, Endo diverged from the cultural stress on the supremacy of strength in which he was steeped in favour of aiding the ailing. Acutely affected by the abhorrent aspects of society, he sought solace in the theistic strive for their notion of a unified goodness. Writing relentlessly, he produced with profound prolificity, thus making it probable that every piece present in his publications is purposeful. From this perspective, consider that he presents a panorama of problems in Wonderful Fool: Tomoe’s hollow materialism, Takamori’s aimlessness, Osako’s vanity, Endo’s despair, bystanders’ carelessness, common tribalism, Kanai and Kobayashi’s selfishness, and societal stagnation. Think. What common thread underlies all of these myriad manifestations of a misguided world?
