Since his inception in interwar imperial Japan, Endo caught no breaks from the brutality of the world - within and without his home country. Stricken with sickness and strife, Endo diverged from the cultural stress on the supremacy of strength in which he was steeped in favour of aiding the ailing. Acutely affected by the abhorrent aspects of society, he sought solace in the theistic strive for their notion of a unified goodness. Writing relentlessly, he produced with profound prolificity, thus making it probable that every piece present in his publications is purposeful. From this perspective, consider that he presents a panorama of problems in Wonderful Fool: Tomoe’s hollow materialism, Takamori’s aimlessness, Osako’s vanity, Endo’s despair, bystanders’ carelessness, common tribalism, Kanai and Kobayashi’s selfishness, and societal stagnation. Think. What common thread underlies all of these myriad manifestations of a misguided world?

## <span style="color: #880D2C">|</span> Introspection
There are various ways of answering this - many of which are likely worth consideration - but the issue we presently address is introspection - specifically the lack thereof in Wonderful Fool.
Before discussing it in the context of Wonderful Fool, however, the innate importance of introspection must be understood. Per Merriam-Webster[^6], it is “a reflective looking inward: an examination of one’s own thoughts and feelings”. In short, it is a necessary component of significant growth as error analysis cannot truly function in its absence. Consider the following chain of thought:
- Society consists of individual people
- People can think about themselves (i.e. introspection)
- People make errors
- People can learn and improve from their errors
- This learning is most effective when the person thinks about why/how they erred (again, introspection)
- This is applicable to literally every facet of every person’s life as it is a fundamental component of human development
- Aggregated, these improvements (or lack thereof) make more competent members of society (or less)
- Moreover, this effect on society is self-reinforcing:
 
    Person is idiotic -> person behaves idiotically -> idiotic environment -> more idiots
    Less idiotic person -> less idiotic society -> less idiotic environment -> fewer idiots
    
So, in terms of global issue criteria:
1. Its significance is at the scale of anything and everything that can be affected by sentient beings
2. It is not only transnational but also transcends time and space altogether, seeing as it is an innately conceptual force
3. It has innumerable impacts on every facet of life for any sentient creature that has existed long enough to make and learn from at least one error

[Transnational scale](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2012.00080/full)[^2]

Frankly, the evidence ought to speak for itself, but in case not - 
Works representative of the foundations of culture and society have, across temporal and spatial barriers alike, reflected the historically-sound rise in introspection which has been integral to the very roots of civilization and its gradual development. Though logic alone would suffice to demonstrate its scale and significance, empirical evidence of these does not get much clearer than this. So too is the case with everyday impacts, but to see this more concretely, note that introspection necessarily affects perception and perception necessarily affects behaviour, which, in turn, determines life experience. As you read about the drastically diverging directions of these two individuals’ lives, consider how each could have played out differently, had they reflected more or less.

  <summary>Transcript</summary>
 
- Now, within the bounds of Wonderful Fool, Endo submerges his story in a smothering silence, subtly suggesting through the near total absence of introspection - subverted solely by the sublime saviour Gaston - the necessity of it to surpass susciety’s cyclical sickness. This is best understood from the thematic framework that Wonderful Fool serves to illustrate how susciety desperately needs compassion to fill the void left by modern materialism but tragically lacks it.

 
- This lack cannot be entirely accounted for by any single factor, but the corresponding absence of introspection undoubtedly precludes the deep understanding required to resolve it. It is for this reason that even after the coming of a saviour - such as Gaston, Kaguya, or, in the Christian pantheon, Je-sus himself - people still regress after their saviour must inevitably return to whence they came. Such people may be temporarily inspired to act differently, but if they do not reflect to understand the purpose behind that action, it tends to falter. 

 
- From the exposition, Endo wastes no time establishing the multitude of ills inflicted by people’s misguidance: even in the first paragraph, the pleasant mood established by the visual imagery of blooming trees is immediately interrupted by the discordant voice of Tomoe, followed in near agonizing detail with Takamori’s strategy for dealing with his sister, drawing out the pacing to match Takamori’s sloth and give readers time to realize how purposeless he must be for his procrastination to be his defining characteristic. Endo further frames the two foils with an astute allusion to their namesakes, relative to whom they are measured. In so doing, he directs focus to the relatively abstract idealistic layer of their character, making their less concrete but no less consequential shortcomings more apparent as their clashes continue ceaselessly for the entirety of the next 6 pages. Undoubtedly, readers are meant to note how pitiful it is for Takamori to have nothing more important to think about than his sister’s annoyances and for Tomoe, despite her wealth, to be so discontent as to be angered by her brother’s inadequacy. Endo goes further to make it excessively evident how aimless Takamori is by satirically labeling his reach for a cigarette a “strong act of will” and explicitly stating how this lie-in, rather than any true purpose, is what keeps him going throughout the work week. Tomoe, on the other hand, is shown to be self-motivated in her career pursuits and yet the inordinate anger with which she snaps at him, as Endo illustrates through the exclamation marks used almost exclusively by Tomoe, strongly suggests she is not truly satisfied. Critically, at no point in their responses to their bouts does either sibling think about how they might improve themselves. Their failure, above all, lies in their internal blindness and thus they learn nothing - neither the compassion Endo promotes through Gaston nor even something selfishly satisfying enough to render their petty squabbles as inconsequential to their eyes as those of the reader. Though entirely implied so far, this interpretation rests on the omniscient point of view from which Endo, an exceptionally thorough author, writes. While an absence of introspection would be meaningless in a more limited point of view or from an author that feasibly might neglect rather than deliberately omit such details, it speaks tremendous volumes in Wonderful Fool. Furthermore, Endo overtly references internal depth when, on page 52, he has Takamori point out with somewhat uncharacteristically figurative language that Gaston “may be a man as deep as the ocean, who doesn’t get hung up on all these trivialities”, simultaneously drawing attention to one of Gaston’s distinguishing features and creating the transitory impression of lasting character development before Takamori shatters any such illusion by pivoting this comment into nothing more than another spite toward Tomoe. Here, as previously established, they fail to truly learn from Gaston because they seemingly see only externalities. This trend is consistent across all characters save Gaston, so they will be covered more rapidly:

 
- After the events of the Couillon (that is, embarrassing himself by fleeing with abandon without even attempting to help Tomoe and being called an ape by Gaston), Osako learns absolutely nothing by the time he meets her next on page 136. Despite how Endo repeatedly points out in detail the expressiveness of Tomoe’s face and nose especially, how Osako obviously values Tomoe’s opinion of him, and how clearly disdainful Tomoe had been of him, Osako changed nothing at all. In fact, Endo goes out of his way to make a point of describing how elegantly attired Osako is to further highlight the absurdity of his utterly superficial approach to an issue that, to any sentient being, is obviously caused by his internal hollowness. It is almost comical how completely devoid of thought he must be to not recognize the emptiness of character he has to match his head. It becomes evident that this lack of introspection infests more than a few particular people when, on pages 64 and 65, a mass of spectators make no effort to prevent Gaston from being beaten and, upon realizing his helplessness, are somewhat ashamed, for - verbatim, “some reason or other”. Had he intended it, it is inconceivable that Endo could not have provided more detail; the lack thereof is significant in that, even in reaction to complicity in someone’s beating, they do not even attempt to think about why they feel shame (or else what they did wrong). It is no wonder, then, that in a susciety where introspection’s absence is so pervasive, stagnation abounds, hence Endo’s conception of it as a swamp. The people’s minds are as stuck as the mud and their self-understanding as opaque. 

 
- Even with Endo (the character), who shows himself to be quite thoughtful in planning assassinations, there is no real understanding of self. In recounting his backstory regarding his brother’s execution and family’s deaths, there is no mention of motivation: that is, he spends not so much as a second stepping back to consider what seeking vengeance would do for him - he simply jerks his knee in an emotional response to his brother’s death without a second thought. Had he done so, the truth of vengeance’s immaturity and ultimate futility, which is so obvious to someone who sees so much as a centimeter below the surface, might have dawned on him - saving not just those he would no longer seek to kill from death but also himself from the agonized, utterly nihilistic state into which he fell. The extent of his underlying uncertainty unambiguously emerges at the climax on pages 225 and 226 where all the book’s tension culminates in Endo’s internal schism where, despite purporting to have dedicated his life to getting back at the officers responsible for his brother’s death, he fails to finish the job even with, and I quote, “all his remaining strength”, passing out from the effort as the vigorous voices within vividly depict his dichotomy. Were he truly committed to killing Kobayashi, he would have no such struggle. Undoubtedly, Endo (the author) must have been aware of Daoist ideology given its influence on Japanese philosophy of the time; its tenet of self-knowledge’s centrality is perhaps best expressed in Sun Tzu’s oft-quoted Art of War: “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles”. Though Endo (the character) knew his enemies well, he knew not himself and therefore failed, unable to stand divided. The less known continuation of the quote follows: “If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat”. Such is the tragedy of Endo’s foil in Gaston - he is the only character that introspects and thus the only one to know himself enough to see past the world’s many pitfalls - and yet, being too innocent to fully understand the enemy that is the tendencies of those he sought to help, his altruistic efforts were doomed to go nowhere. Nonetheless, he was the most and only truly purposeful character, and that, even in failure, made his life more meaningful. After returning from getting beaten in the street, Gaston unwaveringly focused on his desire to cultivate trust and compassion, thought about why he was there, and thereby realized the need to leave the comfort of the Higaki’s house, even having the self-awareness to admit: “I’m a coward. Maybe tomorrow my spirit no good. Will want to be at Takamori’s house again”. Notably he does so with neither shame nor hesitation, and is unshakeable in his decision despite his usual agreeableness. This determination contrasts starkly with Endo’s hesitance, demonstrating how even a fool can be greater than the sharpest killer if the latter does not know themself. Gaston maintains this determination by reminding himself of his purpose when overcoming discomfort on pages 102 when he decides to go with Endo and starting on page 174 where, for 7 long pages, he resists Tomoe’s appeals for him to stay. So strong is his will - enabled principally by introspection - that, in his last moments, he even defied death itself long enough to save Endo’s life, tanking blow after blow as still he struggles against the swamp, succumbing solely when Endo’s safety was secure. Sadly, such sentience was not shared - ultimately, when Gaston had to leave, Takamori and Tomoe, representing the rest of the populace, regress to their purposeless lives. In the long term, until they introspect and resolve their problems within, in the swamp they will remain.

All that said, it’s worth noting that the role of introspection in Wonderful Fool is shaped - and limited - by Endo’s perception of a unified good to which all can and ideally would aspire, a divine light shining in the dark. In Wonderful Fool, the lack of introspection is a barrier specifically to the trust and compassion Gaston, the “wonderful” fool and hero, embodies. In reality, introspection is not so narrow; it is a route to self-knowledge, which is prerequisite to purposeful, fulfilling pursuits and meaningful growth. Many may find that this process leads them towards the same light Endo sees; others go elsewhere. That is to say, it is a means to a relative and individual, rather than an ideologically monolithic, end. So when next you find yourself discontent, consider taking a moment to consider why (and what might be done about it). It is neither hard nor particularly complex, yet many people still manage to be NPCs.
